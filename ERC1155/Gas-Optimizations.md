## Optimization Details

### Modify optimizer options

Optimizer configuration can be modified to reduce gas prices paid by users.

This will make deployed basecode bigger, but more gas efficient during usage. As it is bigger, it will cost more during contract deployment (HeyMint will pay higher fees).

Optimizer "runs" variable was set to `1000`. Setting it to `10000` increases deployment gas price, but reduces usage gas price. Note that after `10000`, there is an error on the D reference contract, it will be too big for deployment.

Configuration in `hardhat.config.js`:
```js
  solidity: {
    version: '0.8.18',
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 10000,
      },
    },
  },
```

### HeyMintERC1155Child
#### constructor
##### Initial code
- Lines: `32-34`
```solidity
        IAddressRelay addressRelay = IAddressRelay(
            StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_ADDRESS_RELAY_SLOT).value
        );
```

##### Optimized code
- Explanations: Reading value on-chain (through storage) is not mandatory, as value is known as a local variable.
- Average gas saved: `1330`
```solidity
        IAddressRelay addressRelay = IAddressRelay(
            _addressRelay //Zigtur Gas Optimization: Do not read from storage here
        );
```



### AddressRelay
#### Removing elements
In AddressRelay, elements are deleted from array by setting zero value. But it doesn't reduce array length. As all elements are read when looping through array and cold storage access is expensive, deleting an element using another way could be better.

A way to delete it would be to copy last element to the slot where value should be deleted, and popping out last element. This will reduce array length, and avoid looping through unused elements (set to `zero`). 

On a long-term basis, if there are multiple evolutions, arrays will be very long and gas consuming. This improvement should be implemented for long-term purposes.
